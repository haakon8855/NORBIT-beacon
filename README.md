# NORBIT Calibration App

## Installation guide
To install the calibration app, follow the steps below.

### Requirements
- Android 8.0 or newer

### Install using .apk
To install using an .apk-file, download the .apk from [releases](https://github.com/haakon8855/NORBIT-beacon/releases). This can be download directly to the Android device or moved using some other method, such as USB file transfer or via cloud storage.  
With the .apk on the Android device, install the app by launching the .apk.
During installation, you might need to allow installation of apps from unknown
sources if you haven't done so already.  
When installation completes, launch the app.

### Build and install using Android Studio
Clone the repository using Android Studio and build the application. After
building, the app can be installed directly onto the device by connecting via
USB. Alternatively, the app can be tested using Android Studio's Android
emulator to test directly on the computer.

If direct installation on an Android device using USB is preferred, developer
mode must be activated on the device. The method to activate developer mode
varies between different Android versions.  
In Android 8.0, go to `Settings>>About Phone` and tap the phone's build number
seven times.  
Then navigate to `Settings>>System>>Developer Options` and enable
**USB-debugging**.  
Android Studio should now recognize the Android device when
connected to the computer via USB.
